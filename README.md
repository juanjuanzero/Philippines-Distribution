## README file for my first project

This project is a remake of the my uncle's website awsgentec.biz. When i saw the website initially i was blown away by the content that was presented. It was too much. I felt as though i needed to bare it down to the essentials. Therefore, you see only three pages: an intro page, a Services page and a Projects Page.

The bones of the material:

The intro page
It basically present an introduction to the company for someone who would land on it from their fb page or from a link through their account. There is a contact form at the bottom of the page that can be filled out (although submission functionality is not yet enabled).

Services page & Projects page
generally these two are the same page it contains large images that have "learn more" buttons if the user wanted to know more information.

Code Louisville Requirements:
Custom Javascript: was done through the learn more buttons that inserts text into div elements. the js also changes the buttons value to/from "learn more" to "hide"
Custom CSS: i did not use any frameworks to build these pages. all of my css is custom. 
Responsiveness: The elements resize from small to large viewports. the nav links also change from stacked to inline
