## README file For PROJECT

This project is a remake of the my uncle's website awsgentec.biz. When i saw the website initially i was blown away by the content that was presented. It was too much. I felt as though i needed to bare it down to the essentials. With the goal of getting potential clients' contact. You will see three pages: an intro page, a Services page and a Projects Page.

The Intro Page
It basically present an introduction to the company for someone who would land on it from their fb page or from a link through their account. There is a contact form at the bottom of the page that can be filled out (although submission functionality is not yet enabled).

Services Page & Projects Page
Generally, these two are the same page it contains large images that have "learn more" buttons if the user wanted to know more information.

Project Scope of Work:
Create a website with Custom JavaScript, Custom CSS, and is responsive to different screen sizes.

Custom Javascript: Was completed through the "Learn more" and "hide" buttons that inserts text into div elements. the js also changes the buttons value to/from "learn more" to "hide"

Custom CSS: No frameworks were use to build these pages. All of my css is custom.

Responsiveness: The elements resize from small to large viewports including mobile devices. The nav links also change from stacked to inline.
